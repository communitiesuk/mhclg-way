This website is run by the MHCLG Way team at the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG). We want
as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
