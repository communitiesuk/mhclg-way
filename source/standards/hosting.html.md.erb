In MHCLG, we use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Microsoft Azure] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb) to host our services.

We follow the [Government Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) and use AWS and Azure managed cloud services and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to host our services rather than using our own hardware.

## AWS

## Azure
