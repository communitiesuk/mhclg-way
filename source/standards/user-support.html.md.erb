# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Support Operations team help DLUHC service teams respond to user enquiries, providing 1st line support for many teams within DLUHC including [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) and [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify).

## Zendesk

Support Operations require DLUHC teams to use [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) to manage communications with service users. Support Operations work with DLUHC teams to help manage Zendesk setup and configuration, for example with:

- choosing agent types, groups and ‘pass-through’ to other government departments
- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/) considerations, such as data disclosure and data retention

## Support lines for your service

DLUHC teams provide support in 3 groups, known as ‘lines’, for each product.

### 1st line user support

1st line support provide resolution for basic user enquiries and triage frequent, repeatable incidents. For example, issues signing in.

### 2nd line technical support

2nd line support provide direct incident resolution and triage user requests. For example, when users receive timeout errors or performance issues.

### 3rd line product teams

3rd line support are technical specialists associated with an existing product team. Their involvement in incident management is limited to the diagnosis and resolution of more complex incidents, such as a data or security breach, or a complete service outage.

## Document routes to support

Document the routes into each support line for your service. For example, users might contact 1st line support using an online form or by email. 2nd line support respond to issues raised through 1st line support and also alerts from failed tests, monitoring and vulnerability scans.

Understanding your service’s routes into support will make sure support and product teams monitor the relevant channels. It will also make sure your service users and team understand how to reach the level of support they need.

## Support hours and support rotas

Document and share your support team’s operating hours. Many DLUHC teams operate a rota for their 2nd line support and escalation contacts.
