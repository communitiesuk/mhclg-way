## JIRA Service Desk

MHCLG services use [JIRA Service Desk](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/features/service-desk) to manage communications with service users.
There is a [dedicated Service Now request to set up a new JIRA Project](https://mhclg.service-now.com/sp_mhclg?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=8a4ff0dd1bdfd21063df43b6b04bcb53) that can be configured to include JIRA Service Desk.

## Support lines for your service

MHCLG teams provide support in 3 groups, known as ‘lines’, for each product.

### 1st line user support

1st line support provide resolution for basic user enquiries and triage frequent, repeatable incidents. For example, issues signing in.

Several teams leverage an ongoing contract for [XBP Europe’s contact centre](https://xbpeurope.com/solutions/contact-centre-services/) to handle phone calls and to triage incoming JIRA Service Desk tickets.

### 2nd line technical support

2nd line support provide direct incident resolution and triage user requests. For example, when users receive timeout errors or performance issues.

### 3rd line product teams

3rd line support are technical specialists associated with an existing product team. Their involvement in incident management is limited to the diagnosis and resolution of more complex incidents, such as a data or security breach, or a complete service outage.

## Document routes to support

Document the routes into each support line for your service. For example, users might contact 1st line support using an online form or by email. 2nd line support respond to issues raised through 1st line support and also alerts from failed tests, monitoring and vulnerability scans.

Understanding your service’s routes into support will make sure support and product teams monitor the relevant channels. It will also make sure your service users and team understand how to reach the level of support they need.

## Support hours and support rotas

Document and share your support team’s operating hours. Many MHCLG teams operate a rota for their 2nd line support; most
MHCLG teams offer support on a 9-5 basis rather than 24 hours.
