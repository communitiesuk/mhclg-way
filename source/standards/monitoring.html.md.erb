In MHCLG, we follow the Service Manual guidance on how to [monitor the status of services][] and set [performance metrics][].

We recommend using a 3rd party service to monitor your serviceâ€™s availability from outside our network. To further make sure your service is working, you should:

* run regular [smoke tests][] using a browser automation app such as Selenium
* implement a tool to ensure user journeys are working as you expect
* monitor applications for errors using an error tracking app such as [Sentry][]
* implement configuration management to set up repeatable monitoring

## Using metrics-based monitoring

Collecting metrics on the performance of your service is useful for [capacity planning][] and autoscaling. You should apply metrics-based monitoring to measure aggregated numerical data about your service and create dashboards to view metrics from your datasource, for example related to your infrastructure or application.

For services hosted in AWS we recommend using [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) unless you have more specific needs.
