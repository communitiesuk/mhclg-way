# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We use [AWS and Azure for hosting](../standards/hosting.html).
Most cloud resources support tagging and MHCLG has existing policies to define tags for both [Azure](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/Azure%20tagging.aspx) and [AWS](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/AWS-TAgging-Policy.aspx)

This page contains a list of expected resource level tags. For further information please refer to the Sharepoint pages above.

## Why tag?

The main reasons for tagging are:

 - To be able to understand costs (by assisting queries in Cost Explorer). These tags are are pre-approved as cost allocation tags in AWS.
 - To understand the provenance of resources (by tagging with metadata)
 - To assist in understanding data and resource compliance and security risk

## AWS Resource Level Tags
The following tags are mandatory for all AWS resources:
 - Name: The name of the resource
 - Project: The name of the project that owns the resource
 - System: The software system this resource supports

 For example:
 ```
    tags = {
        Name    = "${terraform.workspace}-funding-service-vpc"
        Project = "Funding Service"
        System  = "Funding Service"
    }
 ```
