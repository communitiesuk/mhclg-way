Read this guide when you need to name components for your software product, for example applications, software libraries, plugins or frameworks. Your users should understand what something does from its name.

## Your product name should be self-descriptive

Avoid using puns, acronyms or branding for names as this makes it difficult for others to understand what it does.

Make sure you use the same name consistently whenever you’l referring to the same product. For example the name of the Delta application’s GitHub repository is [communitiesuk/delta](https://github.com/communitiesuk/delta).

These MHCLG product names clearly communicate their purpose:

- [Find an energy certificate](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate)
- [Register to vote](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote)
- [Submit social housing lettings and sales data](https://submit-social-housing-data.communities.gov.uk/)

These MHCLG product names are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- [Delta](https://delta.communities.gov.uk)
- [E-CLAIMS](https://eclaims.communities.gov.uk/esif-web/login)
- [Atlas](https://atlas.communities.gov.uk/)

The Service Manual has [guidance on naming
services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service), and this will be relevant when naming applications or packages.
