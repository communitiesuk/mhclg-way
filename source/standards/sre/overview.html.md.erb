SRE as a paradigm, as practised within Google, offers a way of managing the inherent tension between a product teamâ€™s wish to achieve velocity in feature delivery, and what would traditionally be an operations team of sysadmins whose responsibility is to keep deployed environments stable.

[Point 14 of the GOV.UK Service Standard][] codifies the responsibilities of a GOV.UK service team to provide a reliable service. The Google SRE paradigm, which includes the concepts of SLOs, SLIs, and error budgets, can be a useful one to adopt as it will assist in setting fine-grained service level expectations, and ensuring your team is able to deliver features and evolve your service while adhering to these agreed service levels.
