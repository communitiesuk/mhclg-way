Many teams in MHCLG use [Microsoft Azure][] as their infrastructure provider. 

## Request Azure super user or test tenant access

People joining MHCLG do not automatically have access to the Azure test tenant. To grant a user access to youâ€™ll need to follow the guidance on [Azure user identities](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/Azure-Platform-Overview.aspx#user-identities) and request access via [ServiceNow](https://mhclg.service-now.com.mcas.ms/sp?id=sc_category&sys_id=e9b5a0441b4666502d5465f2b24bcba3&catalog_id=-1&spa=1).
