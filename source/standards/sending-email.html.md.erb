Use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) when sending notifications to users from a MHCLG service, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

Thereâ€™s a [complete feature list](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features) available of what you can do with GOV.UK Notify, and you can also register for [a Notify account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register) here.

The Service Manual has further information related to [sending emails from your service domain](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/how-to-email-your-users).
