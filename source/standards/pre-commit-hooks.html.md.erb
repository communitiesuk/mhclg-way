[Git hooks](https://githooks.com/) are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive.

Pre-commit hooks are useful in detecting secrets automatically before developers commit work locally on their machines.
MHCLG recommends a pre-commit git hook called [Detect Secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) for preventing secrets being commited to git.

[Github](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection) also now offers secret scanning and push protection for certain repositories.
