[Git hooks](https://githooks.com/) are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. Pre-commit hooks are useful in detecting secrets automatically before developers commit work locally on their machines.

The Cabinet Office Digital Cyber Security team has recommended a pre-commit git hook called [Detect Secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) for preventing secrets being commited to git.
