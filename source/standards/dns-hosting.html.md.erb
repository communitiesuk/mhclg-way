To ensure users can connect to your service, you'll need accurate Domain Name System (DNS) records and a DNS provider to supply your DNS nameservers.

DNS is managed centrally by the [Cloud Platforms team](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/What-do-we-offer-.aspx) and you will need approval from the [Technical Design Authority (TDA)](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sites/TechnicalDesignAuthorityPublic) for any new domains and nameserver delegation.

If you are building a service that faces the public you should be using a gov.uk domain, which requires you to pass a service assessment.  You can read more about [gov.uk service domains and DNS](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name) in the Service Manual.
