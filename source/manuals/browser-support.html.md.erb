Test your service in [the browsers listed in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices).

Internal facing services should prioritise Edge, as this is the only offered browser available within DLUHC.

You should also [test your service with assistive technologies](/manuals/accessibility.html#testing-with-assistive-technologies).
