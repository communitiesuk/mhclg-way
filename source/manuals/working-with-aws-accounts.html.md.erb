Many teams in MHCLG use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] as their infrastructure provider. 

## Request AWS user access

People joining MHCLG do not automatically have access to AWS. To grant a user access to AWS youâ€™ll need to follow the guidance [How to Request an AWS User Account](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/AWS-IAM-Account-Request.aspx).

###  Use the command line

There are several command line tools you can use to work with AWS, such as:

* [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - to manage your AWS services
* [AWS Shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell) - an integrated shell for working with the AWS CLI
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure

These tools need credentials to access AWS. We recommend using [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#readme) to manage your credentials.

#### Installing aws-vault

[aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#readme) needs to be installed and available on your `PATH`. The
easiest way to do this is via Homebrew: `brew install --cask aws-vault`.

#### Using aws-vault  
Follow the guidance in [Programmatic Access and Federated Access](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/sites/CloudPlatforms/SitePages/Programmatic-Access-and-Federated-Access.aspx).


You can execute commands with credentials stored in AWS Vault using the `aws-vault exec` command.
For example, to list S3 buckets in the developer account run:

```
aws-vault exec developer -- aws s3 ls
```
