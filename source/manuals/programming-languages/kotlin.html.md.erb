# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This document describes how we write Kotlin code at MHCLG. It is a list of
guidelines that developers should follow in order to make code more consistent
across all Kotlin projects, making it easy for developers to change projects
or start new ones.

## Introduction

The guidance set out here should be followed in conjunction with the advice on
the main [programming languages manual page](../programming-languages.html).

**TODO**: Paragraph about when/why to choose Kotlin for a new project.

## TODO - developers with opinions about Kotlin to add guidance
