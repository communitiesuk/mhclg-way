# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This document describes how we write TypeScript code at MHCLG. It is a list of
guidelines that developers should follow in order to make code more consistent
across all TypeScript projects, making it easy for developers to change projects
or start new ones.

## Introduction

The guidance set out here should be followed in conjunction with the advice on
the main [programming languages manual page](../programming-languages.html).

If you would like to use static typing consider using the JavaScript extension
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This has the advantage of making
it easier to prevent runtime errors, by adding type information to variables or
parameters and transpiling the source to JavaScript, reporting errors when
wrong types are used.

## TODO - developers with opinions about TypeScript to add guidance

This could be along the lines of [Node.js guidance found in the GDS Way][gdsway-nodejs]

[gdsway-nodejs]: https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/manuals/programming-languages/nodejs/
